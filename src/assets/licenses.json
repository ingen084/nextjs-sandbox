It gives you the ability to pass style props\n\n```jsx\n<Box color=\"tomato\" _hover={{ bg: \"red.500\", color: \"white\" }}>\n  Welcome to Box\n</Box>\n```\n\nFlex is just a `Box` with `display: flex`\n\n```jsx\n<Flex>\n  <Box flex=\"1\">Box 1</Box>\n  <Box>Box 2</Box>\n</Flex>\n```\n\nStack is used to group elements and apply a spacing between them. It stacks its\nchildren vertically by default.\n\n```jsx\n<Stack spacing=\"20px\">\n  <Box>Box 1</Box>\n  <Box>Box 2</Box>\n</Stack>\n```\n\nAspectRatio is used to constrain its child to specific aspect ratio. It is\nmostly used for embedding videos, images, and maps.\n\n```jsx\n<AspectRatio ratio={16 / 9}>\n  <img src=\"./some-ig-story\" alt=\"Instagram story\" />\n</AspectRatio>\n```\n\nWrap is used to manage the distribution of child elements that are liable to\nwrap. It is mostly used for button groups, tag group, badge group, and chips.\n\n```jsx\n<Wrap spacing={3}>\n  <Box>Box 1</Box>\n  <Box>Box 2</Box>\n</Wrap>\n```\n\nBadge is used to render a badge. It can come in different variants and color\nschemes as defined in the `theme.components.Badge`\n\n```jsx\n<Badge variant=\"solid\" colorScheme=\"green\">\n  Verified <FaCheck />\n</Badge>\n```\n\nCenter is used to vertically and horizontally center its child\n\n```jsx\n<Center bg=\"blue.500\" borderRadius=\"4px\" boxSize=\"40px\">\n  <FaPhoneIcon />\n</Center>\n```\n\nContainer is used to manage content areas on a website or blog. It centers\nitself using `margin-left: auto` and `margin-right: auto`. It also applies a\ndefault max-width of `60ch` (60 characters)\n\n```jsx\n<Container>\n  <BlogContent />\n</Container>\n```\n\nSpacer is a component that takes up the remaining space in a flex container. It\nis mostly useful to manage space and wrapping in flex containers\n\n```jsx\n<Flex>\n  <Box boxSize=\"40px\" />\n  <Spacer />\n  <Box boxSize=\"40px\" />\n</Flex>\n```"

You'll get access to the internal state\n`isOpen` and method `onClose`.\n\n```jsx\n<Menu>\n  {({ isOpen }) => (\n    <React.Fragment>\n      <MenuButton>{isOpen ? \"Close\" : \"Open\"}</MenuButton>\n      <MenuList>\n        <MenuItem>Download</MenuItem>\n        <MenuItem onClick={() => alert(\"Kagebunshin\")}>Create a Copy</MenuItem>\n      </MenuList>\n    </React.Fragment>\n  )}\n</Menu>\n```\n\n### Letter Navigation\n\nWhen focus is on the `MenuButton` or within the `MenuList` and you type a letter\nkey, a search begins. Focus will move to the first `MenuItem` that starts with\nthe letter you typed.\n\n> Open the menu, try and type any letter, say \"S\" to see the focus movement.\n\n```jsx\n<Menu>\n  <MenuButton\n    px={4}\n    py={2}\n    transition=\"all 0.2s\"\n    borderRadius=\"md\"\n    borderWidth=\"1px\"\n    _hover={{ bg: \"gray.100\" }}\n    _expanded={{ bg: \"red.200\" }}\n    _focus={{ outline: 0, boxShadow: \"outline\" }}\n  >\n    File <ChevronDownIcon />\n  </MenuButton>\n  <MenuList>\n    <MenuItem>New File</MenuItem>\n    <MenuItem>New Window</MenuItem>\n    <MenuDivider />\n    <MenuItem>Open...</MenuItem>\n    <MenuItem>Save File</MenuItem>\n  </MenuList>\n</Menu>\n```\n\n### Just another example.\n\n```jsx\n<Menu>\n  <MenuButton>Your Cats</MenuButton>\n  <MenuList>\n    <MenuItem minH=\"48px\">\n      <Image\n        size=\"2rem\"\n        borderRadius=\"full\"\n        src=\"https://placekitten.com/100/100\"\n        alt=\"Fluffybuns the destroyer\"\n        mr=\"12px\"\n      />\n      <span>Fluffybuns the Destroyer</span>\n    </MenuItem>\n    <MenuItem minH=\"40px\">\n      <Image\n        size=\"2rem\"\n        borderRadius=\"full\"\n        src=\"https://placekitten.com/120/120\"\n        alt=\"Simon the pensive\"\n        mr=\"12px\"\n      />\n      <span>Simon the pensive</span>\n    </MenuItem>\n  </MenuList>\n</Menu>\n```\n\n### MenuGroup\n\nTo group related `MenuItems`, use the `MenuGroup` component and pass it a label\nfor the group name.\n\n```jsx\n<Menu>\n  <MenuButton>Profile</MenuButton>\n  <MenuList>\n    <MenuGroup title=\"Profile\">\n      <MenuItem>My Account</MenuItem>\n      <MenuItem>Payments </MenuItem>\n    </MenuGroup>\n    <MenuDivider />\n    <MenuGroup title=\"Help\">\n      <MenuItem>Docs</MenuItem>\n      <MenuItem>FAQ</MenuItem>\n    </MenuGroup>\n  </MenuList>\n</Menu>\n```\n\n## Menu option groups\n\nYou can compose a menu for table headers to help with sorting and filtering\noptions. Use the `MenuOptionGroup` and `MenuItemOption` components.\n\n```jsx\n<Menu closeOnSelect={false}>\n  <MenuButton>MenuItem</MenuButton>\n  <MenuList minWidth=\"240px\">\n    <MenuOptionGroup defaultValue=\"asc\" title=\"Order\" type=\"radio\">\n      <MenuItemOption value=\"asc\">Ascending</MenuItemOption>\n      <MenuItemOption value=\"desc\">Descending</MenuItemOption>\n    </MenuOptionGroup>\n    <MenuDivider />\n    <MenuOptionGroup title=\"Country\" type=\"checkbox\">\n      <MenuItemOption value=\"email\">Email</MenuItemOption>\n      <MenuItemOption value=\"phone\">Phone</MenuItemOption>\n      <MenuItemOption value=\"country\">Country</MenuItemOption>\n    </MenuOptionGroup>\n  </MenuList>\n</Menu>\n```\n\n## `closeOnSelect`\n\n`MenuItem` and `MenuItemOption` can use the `closeOnSelect` prop to override\ntheir parent `Menu`'s behavior.\n\n```jsx\n<Menu>\n  <MenuButton>Open Menu</MenuButton>\n  <MenuList>\n    <MenuGroup title=\"Profile\">\n      {/* Clicking on those items will close the menu (default behavior) */}\n      <MenuItem>My Account</MenuItem>\n      <MenuItem>Payments</MenuItem>\n    </MenuGroup>\n    <MenuDivider />\n    <MenuOptionGroup title=\"Country\" type=\"checkbox\">\n      {/* Clicking on those items will keep the menu open */}\n      <MenuItemOption value=\"email\" closeOnSelect={false}>\n        Email\n      </MenuItemOption>\n      <MenuItemOption value=\"phone\" closeOnSelect={false}>\n        Phone\n      </MenuItemOption>\n      <MenuItemOption value=\"country\" closeOnSelect={false}>\n        Country\n      </MenuItemOption>\n    </MenuOptionGroup>\n  </MenuList>\n</Menu>\n```"

Use them at your own risk.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nyarn add @chakra-ui/popper\n```\n\n## Basic usage\n\nBy default, the `usePopper` hook returns props for the popper, reference and\narrow.\n\n```jsx\nimport { Box } from \"@chakra-ui/layout\"\nimport { Button } from \"@chakra-ui/button\"\nimport { useDisclosure } from \"@chakra-ui/hooks\"\nimport { usePopper } from \"@chakra-ui/popper\"\n\nfunction Example() {\n  const { isOpen, onToggle } = useDisclosure()\n  const { popperRef, referenceRef, getArrowProps } = usePopper()\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Button ref={referenceRef} onClick={onToggle} mb={2}>\n        {isOpen ? \"Click me to see less\" : \"Click me to see more\"}\n      </Button>\n      {isOpen && (\n        <Box ref={popperRef} bg=\"red\">\n          <div\n            {...getArrowProps({\n              style: {\n                background: \"red\",\n              },\n            })}\n          />\n          This is a popover for the button!\n        </Box>\n      )}\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n### Changing the placement\n\nYou can change the placement of the popper by passing the `placement` option to\n`usePopper` and set it to the `popper.js` placement.\n\n```jsx\nconst { popperRef, referenceRef } = usePopper({\n  placement: \"right-start\",\n})\n```\n\n### Match reference's width\n\nIn some cases, you might want to allow the popper take the width of the\nreference. For example, autocomplete, select, etc.\n\nTo achieve this, pass the `matchWidth` option and set it to `true`\n\n```jsx\nconst { popperRef, referenceRef } = usePopper({\n  matchWidth: true,\n})\n```\n\n### Place the popper next to the reference\n\nYou can place the popper next to the reference without margin or distance\nbetween them. Useful to create an autocomplete or typeahead feature.\n\n```jsx\nconst { popperRef, referenceRef } = usePopper({\n  gutter: 0,\n})\n```\n\n### Using inside a fixed container\n\nIf the reference element is inside a fixed container, you should use the `fixed`\nstrategy.\n\n```jsx\nconst { popperRef, referenceRef } = usePopper({\n  strategy: \"fixed\",\n})\n```\n\n## Adding transition\n\nWhen add transitions to a popper component, it is usually advised to apply\npopper and transition to different elements.\n\n```tsx\n// 1. Import components\nimport { useDisclosure } from \"@chakra-ui/hooks\"\nimport { usePopper } from \"@chakra-ui/popper\"\nimport { motion, AnimatePresence, Variants } from \"framer-motion\"\n\nexport function Example() {\n  // 2. Create toggle state\n  const { isOpen, onToggle } = useDisclosure()\n\n  // 3. Create motion variants\n  const slide: Variants = {\n    exit: {\n      y: -2,\n      opacity: 0,\n    },\n    enter: {\n      y: 0,\n      opacity: 1,\n    },\n  }\n\n  // 4. Consume the `usePopper` hook\n  const { getPopperProps, getReferenceProps, getArrowProps, transformOrigin } =\n    usePopper({\n      placement: \"bottom-start\",\n    })\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button {...getReferenceProps({ onClick: onToggle })}>Toggle</button>\n      <div {...getPopperProps()}>\n        <AnimatePresence>\n          {isOpen && (\n            <motion.div\n              transition={{\n                type: \"spring\",\n                duration: 0.2,\n              }}\n              variants={slide}\n              initial=\"exit\"\n              animate=\"enter\"\n              exit=\"exit\"\n              style={{\n                background: \"red\",\n                width: 200,\n                transformOrigin,\n                borderRadius: 4,\n              }}\n            >\n              Testing\n              <div\n                {...getArrowProps({\n                  style: {\n                    background: \"red\",\n                  },\n                })}\n              />\n            </motion.div>\n          )}\n        </AnimatePresence>\n      </div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> When not rendering the popper conditionally, we recommend using\n> `visibility: hidden` instead of `hidden` or `display: none`"

Take for example\nan image upload operation:\n\n- Before upload begins, the upload progress is indeterminate (at this point,\n  it’s just spinning),\n- Once we know the size of the image and begin upload (using axios) then we\n  update the progress value of the CircularProgress (at this point, it shows the\n  progress). CircularProgress also comes with the aria-\\* attributes to make its\n  progress value accessible to screenreaders.\n\nCircularProgress also comes with the aria-\\* attributes to make its progress\nvalue accessible to screenreaders.\n\n### Spinner\n\nIt is more of a “presentational” loading indicator you can use on a page or a\ncomponent, while it’s loading, or before it renders. It doesn't have any\nsemantic meaning.\n\nTo give meaning to a Spinner/loading indicator, ARIA standards require that you\nmark the area of the component/page that’s loading with `aria-busy=true`."

    "licenseText": "# Welcome to Chakra UI ⚡️\n\n[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-2-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors-)\n\n- Works out of the box. Chakra UI contains a set of polished React components\n  that work out of the box.\n\n- Flexible & composable. Chakra UI components are built on top of a React UI\n  Primitive for endless composability.\n\n- Accessible. Chakra UI components follows the WAI-ARIA guidelines\n  specifications.\n\n- Dark Mode 😍: All components are dark mode compatible.\n\n## Looking for the documentation?\n\nhttps://chakra-ui.com\n\n## Installing Chakra UI\n\n⚡️Chakra UI is made up of multiple components and tools which you can import\none by one. All you need to do is install the `@chakra-ui/react` package:\n\n```sh\n$ yarn add @chakra-ui/react\n# or\n$ npm install --save @chakra-ui/react\n```\n\n# Getting set up\n\nTo start using the components, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Wrap your application in a `ThemeProvider` provided by **@chakra-ui/react**\n\n```jsx\nimport { ThemeProvider, ColorModeProvider } from \"@chakra-ui/react\"\n\nconst App = ({ children }) => (\n  <ThemeProvider>\n    <ColorModeProvider>{children}</ColorModeProvider>\n  </ThemeProvider>\n)\n```\n\n`ColorModeProvider` is a context that provides light mode and dark mode values\nto the components. It also comes with a function to toggle between light/dark\nmode.\n\n2. Now you can start using components like so!:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Button } from \"@chakra-ui/react\"\n\nconst App = () => <Button>I just consumed some ⚡️Chakra!</Button>\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\nFeel like contributing? That's awesome! We have a\n[contributing guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) to help guide you.\n\nThe components to be built come from the\n[Aria Practices Design Patterns and Widgets](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1).\n\n## Contributors ✨\n\nThanks goes to these wonderful people\n([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n<!-- markdownlint-disable -->\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/segunadebayo\"><img src=\"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6916170?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"Segun Adebayo\"/><br /><sub><b>Segun Adebayo</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/commits?author=segunadebayo\" title=\"Code\">💻</a> <a href=\"#maintenance-segunadebayo\" title=\"Maintenance\">🚧</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/commits?author=segunadebayo\" title=\"Documentation\">📖</a> <a href=\"#example-segunadebayo\" title=\"Examples\">💡</a> <a href=\"#design-segunadebayo\" title=\"Design\">🎨</a></td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/tioluwani94\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11310046?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"Tioluwani Kolawole\"/><br /><sub><b>Tioluwani Kolawole</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/commits?author=tioluwani94\" title=\"Documentation\">📖</a> <a href=\"#example-tioluwani94\" title=\"Examples\">💡</a> <a href=\"#maintenance-tioluwani94\" title=\"Maintenance\">🚧</a></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<!-- markdownlint-enable -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END -->\n\nThis project follows the\n[all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors)\nspecification.

We've seen CSS architectures like BEM,\nSMACSS, etc, and frameworks like theme-ui, and Tailwind CSS.\n\nWhile these solutions work great, we still think there is a sheer amount of work\nrequired to create a fully customizable, theme-aware component.\n\n## Solutions\n\n### Chakra Elements\n\nChakra provides enhanced JSX elements that can be styled directly via props, or\ncan accept the common `sx` prop for custom styles.\n\nWe'll provide a chakra function, just like styled-components. Users can create\nany component using the `chakra.[element]`. The resulting component will be a\nstyled component and have all system props.\n\n```jsx\n<chakra.button bg=\"green.200\" _hover={{ bg: \"green.300\" }}>\n  Click me\n</chakra.button>\n\n<chakra.h1 fontSize=\"lg\"> Heading </chakra.h1>\n\n// create your own box\nconst Box = chakra.div\n\n// you can still use the `as` prop\n<Box as=\"h1\">This is my box</Box>\n\n// for custom components\nconst ChakraPowered = chakra(YourComponent)\n\n// TS: chakra will infer the types of Link and\n// make it available in props\n<chakra.a as={Link} to=\"/home\"> Click me</chakra.a>\n```\n\n### Chakra Component API\n\nA way to define themeable components in chakra. We believe most re-usable,\natomic components have the following modifiers:\n\n- Size: It has different size variations (small, medium, large)\n- Variant: It has different visual style (outline, solid, ghost)\n- Color scheme (Optional): For a given variant, it can have several color\n  scheme. For example, an outline button with a red color scheme.\n- Color mode (Optional): Components also change their visual styles based on the\n  user preferred color mode (light or dark)\n\nOur goal with this component API is to design a common interface to style any\ncomponent given these characteristics. Here's how it works:\n\n```jsx\n// 1. create a component schema in your theme\nconst theme = {\n  colors: {\n    green: {\n      light: \"#dfdfdf\",\n      normal: \"#dfdfdf\",\n      dark: \"#d566Df\",\n      darker: \"#dfd56f\"\n    },\n    blue: {}\n  },\n  components: {\n    Button: {\n      defaultProps: {\n        variant: \"solid\",\n        size: \"md\",\n\tcolorScheme: \"blue\"\n      },\n      variants: {\n\t// props has colorScheme, colorMode (light mode or dark mode)\n        solid: props => ({\n          bg: `${props.colorScheme}.normal`,\n          color: \"white\",\n        }),\n        outline: {\n          border: \"2px\",\n          borderColor: \"green.normal\"\n        }\n      },\n      sizes: {\n        sm: {\n          padding: 20,\n          fontSize: 12\n        },\n        md: {\n          padding: 40,\n          fontSize: 15\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n// 2. create or import Button from chakra-ui\nimport { Button } from \"@chakra-ui/react\"\n\n// or your own button\nconst Button = chakra(\"button\", { themeKey: \"Button\" })\n\n// 3. use the button. It'll have the visual props defined in defaultProps\n<Button>Click me</Button>\n\n// 4. override the defaultProps\n<Button variant=\"outline\" colorScheme=\"green\">Click me</Button>\n```"

This means when you use the\narrow keys to change tabs, the tab is activated and focused.\n\nThe content of a `TabPanel` should ideally be preloaded. However, if switching\nto a tab panel causes a network request and possibly a page refresh, there might\nbe some notable latency and this might affect the experience for keyboard and\nscreen reader users.\n\nIn this scenario, you should use a manually activated tab, it moves focus\nwithout activating the tabs. With focus on a specific tab, users can activate a\ntab by pressing <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd>.\n\n```jsx\n<Tabs isManual variant=\"enclosed\">\n  <TabList>\n    <Tab>One</Tab>\n    <Tab>Two</Tab>\n  </TabList>\n  <TabPanels>\n    <TabPanel>\n      <p>one!</p>\n    </TabPanel>\n    <TabPanel>\n      <p>two!</p>\n    </TabPanel>\n  </TabPanels>\n</Tabs>\n```\n\n### Tab sizes\n\nYou can change the size of the tab by passing `size` prop. We support 3 sizes\n`sm`, `md`, `lg`\n\n```jsx\n<Tabs size=\"md\" variant=\"enclosed\">\n  <TabList>\n    <Tab>One</Tab>\n    <Tab>Two</Tab>\n  </TabList>\n  <TabPanels>\n    <TabPanel>\n      <p>one!</p>\n    </TabPanel>\n    <TabPanel>\n      <p>two!</p>\n    </TabPanel>\n  </TabPanels>\n</Tabs>\n```"

Or, you can use a custom `toastId`:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from \"react\"\nimport useToast from \"@chakra-ui/toast\"\n\nconst Example = () => {\n  const toast = useToast()\n\n  const id = \"login-toast\"\n\n  const notify = () => {\n    if (!toast.isActive(id)) {\n      toast({ title: \"Dude! I cannot be duplicated\" })\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={notify}>Notify</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Update a toast\n\nWhen you update a toast, the toast options and the content are inherited but\ndon't worry you can update them.\n\n```js\nimport * as React from \"react\"\nimport useToast from \"@chakra-ui/toast\"\n\nconst Update = () => {\n  const toast = useToast()\n\n  const id = React.useRef(null)\n\n  const notify = () => {\n    id.current = toast({\n      title: \"Chidori is not available!\",\n      duration: null,\n    })\n  }\n\n  const update = () => {\n    toast.update(id.current, {\n      title: \"Sharingan is all you have!\",\n      status: \"success\",\n      duration: 5000,\n    })\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={notify}>Notify</button>\n      <button onClick={update}>Update</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```"

Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material.

To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

The page auto-updates as you edit the file.\n\n[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.\n\nThe `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.\n\n## Learn More\n\nTo learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:\n\n- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.\n- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.\n\nYou can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!\n\n## Deploy on Vercel\n\nThe easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.\n\nCheck out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details."
